# User scenarios
I need to clarify what behaviour do I expect to out of this software.
Hence I set some macro and comopnent user stories.

## As a user I want to browse the movie DB
I expect to be able to search by: 
- title matching a phrase.

### I want to see some details on particular movie
I expect to see some basic details about the movie. As a consequence a dedicated screen to display such info on one movie should not required.

For now we have only the following details in mind (subject to change): Title, poster, plot synopsis.

## As a user, I want to select one movie while browsing the large movie DB and add it to my collection
I expect to always get a well noticable feedback on each pull to my collection (in case of both success or failure).

## As a User I want to browse my movies collection

### I want to see some details on particular movie
I expect to check the same information as during browsing the large movie DB

## As a user I want to remove one movie from my collection while browsing it

## As a guest I want to login to my account
I expect to see my collection right after logging in.
